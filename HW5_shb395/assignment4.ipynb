    "# Overview of the analyses that follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, I performed a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test for differences in ride duration between all CitiBike rides that begin during the day versus all rides that begin at night. I also performed a KS test for differences in the age of riders who begin their CitiBike rides in Manhattan versus riders who begin in Brooklyn.\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing the KS test using all of the relevant rides, I took random samples of 200 rides for each category (day, night, Manhattan, and Brooklyn rides) and then performed two more KS tests for day versus night and Manhattan versus Brooklyn rides with the smaller samples. I conducted these tests with smaller sample sizes because with very large sample sizes, the KS test is more likely to find differences in their distributions. (Any two samples will not be identically distributed, and the more information provide to the KS test, the more likely it is to find differences in sample distributions.) With the smaller sample sizes, differences in distributions (if they exist) are more meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the two KS tests, I also performed Pearson's and Spearman's correlation tests with 500 randomly selected data points. (I used the same sample sizes for both tests because the tests will otherwise not run.)\n",
    "\n",
    "See below for the null hypotheses and results for each test. For all of the analyses that follow, I used an $\\alpha$ level of .05 to test for true, statistically significant differences that affect related sample groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For my analysis of rides by time of day, I define daytime as 5 am to 4 pm and night as 8 pm to 3 am. And for my analysis of rides by their place of origin, I used four latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates that roughly define Manhattan and Brooklyn. This method is obviously not ideal since these boundaries allow for areas that overlap between Manhattan and Brooklyn and allow for the improper association of parts of other boroughs (especially the Bronx and Queens) with Manhattan and Brooklyn."

    "The results of our Spearman's test tell us that the ride duration and rider age data we tested for trip time of day and origin are highly correlated and that we can be very confident in these results (due to such low p values). We are therefore rejecting the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this makes intuitive sense because we have taken two columns of numerical data, sorted them, and then compared the two sets of data. As the numbers from one column increase, the numbers in the second column also increase. Therefore, there is a predictable positive correlation between the two. In this case, the relationship is even stronger than the Pearson's test, which makes sense because the Spearman's test has more flexibility and is better able to detect correlations that are not strictly linear (the Spearman's test can detect monotonic relationships)."
