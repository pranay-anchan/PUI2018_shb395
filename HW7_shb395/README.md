# HW7 Overview

Assignment 1: For this assignment, I acquired publicly-available PUMA data from NYC Open Data as well as household broadband access information from the Census Bureau's American FactFinder data repository. I merged the data and then plotted houshold broadband access per PUMA. Finally, using LinkNYC location data provided by Professor Bianco, I merged the data again and plotted the distribution of LinkNYC stations per PUMA.

Note on assignment: I discussed the assignment and strategies for data acquisition with Cyrus Blankenship and Pablo Andres Mandiola. We did not explicitly share specific lines of code.
