## HW4 Overview

Assignment 1: For this assignment, I created sets of 100 samples of varying sizes (between 10 and 2000) from randomly generated numbers that follow a particular statistical distribution (normal, Poisson, binomial, Chi-Squared, and logarithmic). I then plotted the data sets individually and then together.

Assignment 2: In assignment 2, I acquired CitiBike data for the months of July and August 2018 and compared the ride durations of Millenial and Generation X aged male riders.

Assignment 3: For assignment 3, I calculated the Z score for a ficitious new bus route to see if the new route was faster or slower than the average ride time along that bus line.

For HW4, I discussed the assignment and ways to interpret or clean data with Cyrus Blankenship and Colin Bradley. We did not explicitly share specific lines of code.
