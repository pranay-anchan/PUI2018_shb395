    "The $\\alpha$ value of .05 that was previously stated corresponds to 2 standard deviations from our population mean of 36. But with a calculated Z score of 2.56 (which is, of course, greater than the 2 standard deviations for our $\\alpha$ value), we are led to conclude that there is a statistically significant effect of the new X8 bus route on average travel time. Therefore, we should reject our null hypothesis. The new bus route, in fact, does reduce travel time for passengers on the X8."
