# Plot review for Samuel Burns

Sam has plotted a heatmap distribution of public tennis faciilities in NYC

### Clarity
The objective of the plot is clear, in that what Sam is trying to convey with the plot. However he has not added the time period, at a glance at only the plot, I wouldn't be able to tell what year this is plotted for.

### Esthetic
The plot is well done in terms of what it is meant to communicate. However, some of the points plotted on the darker areas might be a little harder to grasp, especially if someone has color blindness (I am not honestly sure about this, it is my guess). Maybe the colors for the plot points could have been more standing out in contrast. 

### Honesty
I believe the plot is honestly reproducing the data, as per what Sam has received from the Open NYC and NYC Gov parks data. 

### Improvement
As I mentioned for Esthetics, the colors for the plot points could have been more contrasting as compared to the heatmap for standing out better. Apart from that, really well done on the setup and plot!
