## HW3 Overview

Assignment 1: See below.

Assignment 2: I acquired a dataset from NYC Open Data and plotted two columns of numerical data.

Assignment 3 and 4: I wrote a Python script that will query the locations of all buses on a particular route using the MTA's But Time API.

### Assignment 1

First I created a file called "test.csv" in my repo. Then I pulled the csv (and any other changes) to my local repo. Then I deleted the file and its history using git filter-branch.
