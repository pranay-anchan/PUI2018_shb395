# HW6 Overview

Assignment 1: For this assignment, I acquired and then manipulated NYC PLUTO data, which is a collection of detailed tax lot information for every property in New York City. 

Assignment 2: For this assignment, I performed SQL queries on CitiBike data stored in CartoDB.

Note on assignments: I discussed the assignments and strategies for SQL queries with Cyrus Blankenship and Sam Manzi. We did not explicitly share specific lines of code.
